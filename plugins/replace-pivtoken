# replace-pivtoken: Replace a PIV token with a newly initialized PIV token,
# using the recovery token to authenticate the replacement.
#
# Args:
#   $1 = GUID of the PIV token
#
# Input:
#   The recovery token (base64 encoded)
#   JSON blob similar in format to register-pivtoken
#
# Output:
#   The new recovery token
#
# On success 0 is returned, otherwise a non-zero error is returned.
# kbmd currently only cares about zero vs. non-zero, though any non-zero
# value is logged by kbmd for troubleshooting purposes.  Currently any
# stderr output is discarded (until a better way of dealing with it in kbmd
# is devised).
